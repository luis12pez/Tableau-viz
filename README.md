# Portafolio: Data visualization | Tableau

The purpose of the present repository is to show several case studies using Python and Tableau. Each case study will be presented on its own separate branch, encompassing raw data, analysis, and associated files or links to the visualization. Additionally, every branch will contain a README.cd file providing an explanation of the respective case.

## DATA ANALYSIS WORKFLOW

1. Databases available either in  public serves (such as ElephantSQL) or the file/link will be available to download locally.
2. Data cleaning, primary visualization, and transformation is performed with the help of Python and MS Excel, depending on the specific cases.
3. Final data visualization and dashboarding using Tableau.
